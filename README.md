# api-ai-ios-sdk_demos
Demo apps for api-ai-ios-sdk_demos



based on 
https://github.com/api-ai/api-ai-ios-sdk

Had problems getting example to build 
https://github.com/api-ai/api-ai-ios-sdk/tree/master/ApiAIDemoSwift

so extracted it to standalone project

CREATE ACCOUNT AT https://console.api.ai and 

set up sample Agent using https://api.ai/docs/getting-started/5-min-guide/

Then enter 
Subscription key
Client access token
in AppDelegate
        configuration.clientAccessToken = "......"
        configuration.subscriptionKey = "......"

The try "Weather for Washington" or "Weather for New York"
